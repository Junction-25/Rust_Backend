# Enhanced JSON Comparison System Documentation

## Overview

The property comparison system has been significantly enhanced to provide comprehensive, structured JSON responses instead of PDF reports. The new system offers detailed multi-dimensional analysis with intelligent recommendations and confidence scoring.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Comprehensive Analysis Structure**
The comparison now includes five detailed analysis categories:
- **Price Analysis**: Affordability, price per square meter, savings analysis
- **Space Analysis**: Size advantages, room comparisons, space efficiency
- **Location Analysis**: Proximity, accessibility, neighborhood context
- **Feature Analysis**: Property type matching, unique features, common attributes
- **Value Analysis**: Investment potential, value scoring, ROI considerations

### 2. **Intelligent Recommendations**
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 scale based on multiple factors
- **Reasoning Engine**: Detailed explanations for recommendations
- **Consideration Points**: Important factors for decision-making
- **Summary Generation**: Human-readable recommendation summaries

## API Endpoints

### Property Comparison
**GET** `/comparisons/properties`

**Query Parameters:**
- `property1_id` (required): Integer - First property ID
- `property2_id` (required): Integer - Second property ID

**Example Request:**
```http
GET /comparisons/properties?property1_id=1&property2_id=2
```

**Response:** Complete PropertyComparison JSON object

## Analysis Categories Explained

### 1. Price Analysis
- **Cheaper Property**: ID of the more affordable option
- **Price Savings**: Absolute difference in price
- **Affordability Rating**: Qualitative assessment of price difference
- **Price per sqm**: Cost efficiency comparison

**Rating Scale:**
- "Similar pricing" (< $10,000 difference)
- "Moderate price difference" ($10,000 - $50,000)
- "Significant price difference" ($50,000 - $100,000)
- "Major price difference" (> $100,000)

### 2. Space Analysis
- **Larger Property**: ID of the property with more space
- **Space Advantage**: Absolute difference in area
- **Room Comparison**: Descriptive room count analysis
- **Space Efficiency**: Square meters per room ratio

### 3. Location Analysis
- **Distance Between**: Exact distance in kilometers
- **Location Similarity**: Qualitative proximity assessment
- **Accessibility Notes**: Practical location considerations

**Proximity Categories:**
- "Very close locations" (< 1 km)
- "Same neighborhood" (1-5 km)
- "Same city area" (5-20 km)
- "Different areas" (> 20 km)

### 4. Feature Analysis
- **Property Type Match**: Boolean indicating same property type

## Recommendation Engine

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
The system calculates confidence based on multiple factors:

- **Base Score**: 0.5 (neutral starting point)
- **Price Factor**: +0.2 for significant price advantage
- **Space Factor**: +0.15 for substantial space advantage
- **Location Factor**: +0.1 for similar locations
- **Value Factor**: +0.15 for clear value advantage
- **Maximum**: 1.0 (complete confidence)

### Recommendation Levels
- **High Confidence** (0.8+): "Property X is clearly the better choice"
- **Moderate Confidence** (0.6-0.8): "Property X appears to be the better option"
- **Low Confidence** (< 0.6): "Both properties have similar value"

### Reasoning Categories
- **Price-based**: Affordability and cost advantages
- **Space-based**: Living space and room advantages
- **Location-based**: Proximity and accessibility factors
- **Value-based**: Investment potential and efficiency
